Hi! I am a [Societal Computing](https://sc.cs.cmu.edu/) PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, Software and Societal Systems Department, School of Computer Science. I'm advised by [Lorrie Cranor](https://lorrie.cranor.org/) and I'm affiliated with the CMU CyLab and the [CUPS](https://cups.cs.cmu.edu/) lab.

My research focuses on usable security and privacy, tech policy, and access control. I use mixed methods to understand how people interact with security and privacy systems in practice. My current work examines digital identity systems, investigating how people manage their online identities, whether existing system designs align with users' privacy preferences, and how we can redesign these systems to better support user autonomy and trust.

Recently, I’ve been thinking about **online age verification**. We ran a deceptive experiment to understand how adults respond to online age verification in a realistic access context and shared these findings at the [FTC Age Verification Workshop](https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/news/2026/01/26-ftc-age-verification-workshop.html) in Jan 2026. You can read our [technical report](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sscheffl/docs/2026/AgeVerif2026.pdf) here.

Prior to starting my Ph.D., I worked on projects related to Human-Computer Interaction, Human-Robot Interaction, Usable Privacy and Security, and Accessibility through UROP with the MIT Media Lab and the [REUSE](https://www.cmu.edu/scs/s3d/reuse/) program with CMU's Software and Societal Systems Department. I hold a B.A. in Computer Science and a minor in Philosophy from Wellesley College.

<!--Before Georgia Tech, I worked as an academic professional and consultant for various energy and environmental policy think tanks in Indonesia. I hold a B.S. and M.S. in Petroleum Engineering (specialization in Energy Economics and Policy) from [Institute of Technology Bandung](https://www.itb.ac.id/?n=1728695487), and a M.S. in Economics from Georgia Tech.-->
