Teaching is a transformative part of my academic journey. Inspired by the mentors and teachers who shaped my path, I am committed to guiding students from being passive recipients of theory to becoming active, analytical problem-solvers. I strive to create a classroom environment where students not only master economic tools but also build the confidence to apply them to real-world challenges.
