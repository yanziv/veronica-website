I am enrolled in the [CMU Eberly Future Faculty Program](https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/graduatestudentsupport/futurefacultyprogram.html) where I learn principles of effective course design and pedagogy and receive feedback on my teaching. I also work with undergraduate researchers through the [CMU REUSE](https://www.cmu.edu/scs/s3d/reuse/) program. I value these opportunities to grow as an educator and mentor.
